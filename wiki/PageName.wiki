How to get the current database ip addresses on any machine in the farm


= Details =

You can get the IP addresses of the current databses in the farm by reading /etc/aws/mysql/ on any machine. This is reconfigured when the db nodes are reconfigured.

/etc/aws/hosts/mysql/
/etc/aws/hosts/mysql-master/

The folders above will have a list of empty files where filename is the private IP of the corresponding host.

/etc/aws/hosts/mysql/ - all mysql databases, including slaves and masters
/etc/aws/hosts/mysql-master/ - only masters

Ex.:
/etc/aws/hosts/mysql/1.1.1.1
/etc/aws/hosts/mysql/1.1.1.2

/etc/aws/hosts/mysql-master/1.1.1.2
