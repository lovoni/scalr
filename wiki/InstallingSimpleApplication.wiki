#summary How to install a simple application on Scalr farm.

= Introduction =

This is a fairly basic guide on installing a mysql-enabled application on Scalr farm.
  * Assuming that you do not use version control and using Scalr's scripting engine is over your head.
  * You need to have a running farm with at least app and mysql roles.

== Uploading the script ==
The easiest way to upload files is FTP.

Scalr does not create any FTP logins for you, so yo need to create one.
The easiest way (still not the safest) would be to 
  * Open SSH console (click on the icon in Intances->View page).
  * Create a system user
{{{ 
useradd -d /var/www wwwuser
}}}
  * Set a password for it 
{{{
 passwd wwwuser
}}}
  * Now use "Synchronize to all" for that instance so your changes propagate across all your app instances.

The same for database:
  *  Open console
{{{
 mysql
}}}

This will log you in as root user

2. while in mysql interactive console, 

  *  Create db
{{{
create database newdb;
}}}

  *  Grant access to it

{{{
GRANT ALL ON newdb.* TO 'someuser'@'localhost';
}}}

[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/grant.html More info on GRANT syntax]

  *  Configure your application to use someuser.

  *  Roll in your database dump.

{{
mysql -u someuser -p < ./path/to/dbdump.sql
}}
