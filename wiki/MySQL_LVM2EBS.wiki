This manual will help you to migrate to MySQL+EBS.


= Details =

Before migrating, you should ensure there is no MySQL data bundling is currently performing. Ignoring this can lead to data corruption/loss.
The data for the new role will be taken from the last bundle, so you probably will want to launch bundle manually and wait until it will complete.

*If you use custom mysql role or non mysqllvm role you sholud:*
        # Terminate your farm
        # Remove mysql role from your farm and add mysqllvm role.
        # On MySQL Options tab select EBS as MySQL data storage engine and specify size for EBS volume.
        #) Save & launch farm.



*If you already using mysqllvm role you should:*
        # Terminate your farm
        # Remove mysqllvm role from farm and save it.
        # Edit your farm ad add mysqllvm role once again.
        # On MySQL Options tab select EBS as MySQL data storage engine and specify size for EBS volume.
        # Save & launch farm.
