#summary Introduction to mysqllvm role

* This is a draft

= Introduction =

LVM-enabled mysql role differs by LVM_ENABLED=1 key value in `/etc/scalr_lvm.conf`


= Initialization of LVM-enabled instance =

  # Creates physical volumes on all available disks.
  # Assigns them into a single volume group.
  # Based on config in /etc/scalr_lvm.conf creates three logical volumes: 

On the small instance config looks like:

{{{
# Logical Volume for MySQL data
LV_DATA_NAME="lvol0"
LV_DATA_SIZE="65G"
LV_DATA_MPT="/mnt/mysql-data"

# Logical Volume for MySQL logs and data snapshot
LV_MISC_NAME="lvol1"
LV_MISC_SIZE="75G"
LV_MISC_MPT="/mnt/mysql-misc"

# Logical Volume to snapshot MySQL data
LV_SNAP_NAME="snap"
LV_SNAP_SIZE="9G"
LV_SNAP_MPT="/mnt/mysql-snap"
}}}

4. Deploys directory skeleton from /usr/local/aws/skel


=  Backup snapshot creation =

Unlike the regular bundle, it takes only few seconds to create a snapshot and release table locks.

= Volume sizes and initialization times =

On big instance types LVM uses all available attached devices to create a volume group by default.
Thus instance initialization is time-consuming on mysqllvm64 role.
