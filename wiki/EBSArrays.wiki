= What is a Scalr EBS Array? =

EBS Array is a set of EBS volumes, joined into a single storage device and formatted as ext3. It can be mounted to an instance just like any storage device. 



= Advantages and limitations = 
 
  * Currently  the maximum size of a single array is limited to 10 volumes of 100 GB each, which is *10 TB in total*.


  *. Arrays is a semi-manual thing due to a  long time that filesystem creation takes. Thus, unlike single-volume  EBS  management in Scalr, which can be automated  in few clicks of a mouse, 
Array can only be assigned to a single instance, not a role.

= Usage  = 
You can create array and attach  it to an instance  on Farms->EBS-> Arrays page.
