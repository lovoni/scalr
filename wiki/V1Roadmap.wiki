#summary Scalr v1 Roadmap.
#labels Featured

_This page lists features that Scalr team is currently working on and planning to release soon.
It should not be considered "final" and can be (and will be) re-arranged along the way._


= January 2009 = 

== EBS Arrays == 
Create a storage device (up to 10 TB for now), attach it to an instance. 
Enter the desired size and Scalr will do the rest - create volumes, join them into a single device, create filesystem and mount it on your instance.

== Scripts execution order ==
If you have multiple scripts assigned on a single event, you can select an order in which they will be executed.

== Automatic EBS snapshots ==
Set how frequently Scalr will make snapshots of your volumes. 
Auto-EBS, manual EBS, EBS arrays - all support this feature.

== EBS for mySQL role ==

A single EBS volume is used as datadir on master and to delived latest data to slaves (via snaphots).

== Support for Europe locations ==
Select what region your farm will run in.

== EBS volumes re-attaching to a same instance within a role. == 
If you enable EBS inside a role settings, Volume #1 always gets attached to an instance that is launched 1st, Volume 2 to a second one and so on. Association persists between farm restarts.

==  Attach and mount EBS volume to a particular instance. ==
Set the size and push the button.
 Volumes always get attached and mounted whenever instance boots up.



= Future Release = 
== elastic IPs re-assigning to a same instance within a role==

If you enable elastic IPs inside a role settings, IP #1 always gets attached to an instance that is launched 1st, Volume 2 to a second one and so on. Association persists between farm restarts. 
In mySQL role, 1st IP always gets attached to MySQL master.
 == Cloudfront support == 
Select a bucket, select Application, enter subdomain name, done.


== New extJS-based interface ==
With one-click sorting and other cool goodies. 

== yourfarm.scalr.ws ==
Whenever you create a farm, yourfarm.scalr.ws is created for you. No need to change nameservers, just add CNAME on your current ones. Useful for test farms.

== Misc ==
  * Bye SNMP+REST, hello messaging (ActiveMQ).
  * SSH is no more required on instances
  * Base Windows Role.
  * Diff view  for scripts
  * New Scripting events:  beforeHostTerminate, beforeInstanceLaunch, OnEBSVolumeMounted
