#summary Using the Scalr APT Repository

= What is it for? =

Scalr APT repository contains .deb packages that are intended to be installed on EC2 instances and updated periodically.
Packages contain shell scripts and service configuration files that can modified in the future when we improve Scalr algorithms, adding new features or fixing bugs.

= Installation =
== Add information about APT repository ==
 
For this, download and install scalr_repository package:
{{{
wget http://apt.scalr.net/scalr-repository_0.1_all.deb
dpkg -i scalr-repository_0.1_all.deb
}}}

Download the list of packages in repository:
{{{
apt-get update
}}}

Install scalr-ami-scripts package
{{{
apt-get install scalr-ami-scripts
}}}

Install scalr-ami-configs package 
{{{ 
apt-get install scalr-ami-configs
}}}

= Retaining custom modifications =
What if I made changes to scripts and/or configs?

In most cases, deb packages will not simply replace your config files (like nginx.conf), but rather patch them.

You are not advised to modify Scalr scripts. Use include files (TODO: List of includes) instead. 
If execution of include script fails, the main script continues executing.
