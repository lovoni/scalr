#summary Signing Mindterm SSH Java applet


  * Create keypare in keystore:
`keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa -alias MyCert`

  * Create CSR:
`keytool -certreq -alias MyCert`

  * Send the output certificate signing request to Authority of your choice. Let's assume you received back a SignedCert.cer file with as signed certificate inside. 
  * Import it in the previously created keystore entry:
`keytool -import -alias MyCert -file SignedCert.cer `

  * Sign the mindterm applet:
`jarsigner mindterm.jar MyCert`

  * Verify:
`jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs mindterm.jar`
If you see "jar verified", then applet was signed ok.
