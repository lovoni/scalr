#summary How to handle instance termination or bootup in your application

= Introduction =

Your application might need to know when Scalr launches new instance or instance terminated due to crash, downscaling or synchronization.


= Host up =

Scalr sends `SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrap.11.1 SNMP` trap to all instances.

You can add your bash code to `/usr/local/aws/user/traps/hostup` file.

= Host down =

Scalr sends `SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrap.11.0 SNMP` trap to all instances.

You can add your bash code to `/usr/local/aws/user/traps/hostdown` file.

You may find all traps and corresponding handlers in `/etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf` file on any instance.
